## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark green (#128C7E), similar to WhatsApp's background pattern, to mimic the original design and provide a familiar feel.
- Bot messages: Light gray (#E0E0E0) background with rounded corners, offering a subtle contrast and a clean look.
- User messages: Light teal (#26A69A) background with rounded corners and white text for clear distinction and visual appeal.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif font, for both headlines and body text, providing a modern yet slightly warm feel. This font choice ensures readability and complements the overall chat interface design.
- Use clean, recognizable icons for the audio player controls (play/pause), ensuring ease of use and a familiar experience.
- Maintain a responsive layout to ensure seamless use on various devices, mirroring WhatsApp's accessibility.
- Use a subtle typing animation (three dots) when the bot is 'typing' to simulate real-time interaction.
